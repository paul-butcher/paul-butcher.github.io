title: Licensing Software Engineers

Every so often, a high profile technology failure or ethical transgression occurs, 
and people start talking about professional licensing for software engineers. 
It makes me wonder two things.  What sorts of people advocate for licensing, 
and exactly which activities should require it?

The idea seems to be that "Proper" Engineers have to put their own skin firmly in the game.
A properly licenced Civil Engineer has to sign off the designs of (e.g.) a bridge, and if it collapses
then the consequences could range from being struck off to having criminal charges brought against 
the engineer themselves.  Similarly, they have an ethical code, which could lead to them being 
struck off if they design something evil.

No such requirement exists in the software world.  Proponents opine that if software engineers were
real engineers, who could be punished for developing evil, insecure, or otherwise harmful
applications, then events like the recent Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal would not occur 
(or if they still do, we would somehow be reassured by the fact that someone's career would be over).

Personally, I am opposed to the idea, as I think the negatives outweigh the positives, and that
it basically doesn't make sense.

One thing is that it brings to mind a very old-fashioned, waterfall-style image of 
Software Engineers producing reams of UML diagrams, and handing them over to programmers
to actually make into software.  This is the closest analogy I can think of to the 
Civil Engineer / Builder relationship.  I can't imagine anyone currently working as any kind of
Software Developer wanting to work that way.  I also don't think it would help a great deal.


## What activity should be licensed?

The main concern I have is that I don't understand which particular Software Development 
activities would require the oversight of a licenced practitioner.  Writing code? Publishing 
an executable? Connecting a server to the internet?  

I've never seen a proposal that states this.

### Writing Code

### Publishing an executable

I would hate to see my favourite Open Source projects disappear just because no Engineer is 
willing to put their career or liberty on the line for nothing.

Perhaps if consumers have to build the products themselves, it would be exempt.  However, even as an
experienced software developer, I'm often turned off when a project's installation instructions 
require me to download the source code and build it myself.  Not least because of all the dependencies
which (in such a scenario) I would also have to download and compile.



If it's optional, there's no point.  Imagine being an Engineer and having this conversation with 
your employer.

**Boss:** "Sign this off so that you get all the blame if it goes wrong".

**You:** "What happens if I don't?"

**Boss:** "Nothing, we'll just push it to live and the users will use it anyway"

**You:** "OK, I'll sign!"
